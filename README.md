## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- AnyDesk (for remote connections)
- Modern web browser with WebSocket support
- Network access between clients and server

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Stviri/GINITA-REWORK.git

cd GINITA-REWORK

2. Install Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Configure the application:
   - Update subnet mappings in `server.py`
   - Configure client connection settings in `client.py`
   - Adjust monitoring thresholds if needed

4. Start the server:

python server.py

5. Deploy the client:

python client.py

## üîß Configuration

### Subnet Mapping
Configure branch organization in server.py:

SUBNET_MAPPING = {
"192.168.0": "Home",
"127.0.0": "Localhost",
"192.168.2": "subnet3",
}

### Monitoring Thresholds
Default critical thresholds:
- CPU Usage: 80%
- RAM Usage: 80%
- Disk Space: 80%
- Network Bandwidth: 0.6 MB/s

## üéØ Usage

1. Access the dashboard: `http://localhost:5000`
2. Navigate branches via the sidebar
3. Monitor device status in real-time
4. Click devices for detailed information
5. Use search/filters to find specific devices
6. Mark important devices as favorites
7. Receive notifications for critical events
8. Connect remotely via AnyDesk integration
